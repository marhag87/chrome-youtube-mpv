In order for this extension to work you must first install the native messaging
host from the host directory.

To install the host:
  Run install_host.sh script in the host directory:
    host/install_host.sh
  By default the host is installed only for the user who runs the script, but if
  you run it with admin privileges (i.e. 'sudo host/install_host.sh'), then the
  host will be installed for all users. You can later use host/uninstall_host.sh
  to uninstall the host.
